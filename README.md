Daniel is missing. 

About a year ago, he confided in you about an ancient relic that he had found on a dig in Nepal. He had been hired by dangerous people and did not tell them about the relic.  He claimed he hid it and told no one the location.

He must have known the people were after him, he called one late night and told you to search his office if he didn't survive.

The location of a stolen Nepalese relic is somewhere in the room, you must decode the information you find in order to determine where it can be found.
